## Dart Fundamentals:

#### Variables and Data Types: Practice declaring variables of different data types (int, double, String, bool, lists, maps) and manipulating them.

#### Operators and Expressions: Understand arithmetic, logical, comparison, and assignment operators. Use them in expressions to perform calculations and decision-making.

#### Control Flow Statements: Master if-else, for, and while loops. Use them to control the flow of your Dart programs.

#### Functions and Methods: Learn to create reusable functions and methods with parameters and return values.

#### Classes and Objects: Understand the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Create classes, objects, and interact with them.

## Flutter Basics:

Widgets: Start with the most common widgets like Text, Image, Container, Row, Column, and Stack. Build simple layouts using these widgets.

Layouts: Experiment with different layout strategies (e.g., Center, Align, Expanded) to arrange widgets within your Flutter app.

User Input and State Management: Learn how to handle user input using widgets like TextField and ElevatedButton. Understand basic state management principles using setState().

Navigation and Routing: Practice navigating between different screens within your Flutter app using Navigator and named routes.

Hands-on Projects:

Counter App: Build a simple app that lets users increment or decrement a counter. This helps solidify basic concepts like widgets, layout, and state management.

To-Do List App: Create an app where users can add, remove, and edit to-do items. This introduces data handling and more complex state management.

Simple Calculator: Develop a basic calculator with buttons for arithmetic operations. This solidifies layout, event handling, and logic.

Movie App: Fetch movie data from an API and display a list of movies with details. This introduces networking and working with external data sources.
